- Text emotions classification is the problem of assigning emotion to a text by understanding the context and the emotion behind the text. One real-world example is the keyboard of an iPhone that recommends the most relevant emoji by understanding the text.
- Text emotions classification is the problem of natural language processing and text classification. Here we need to train a text classification model to classify the emotion of a text.

- To solve this problem, we need labelled data of texts and their emotions. I found an ideal dataset to solve this problem on Kaggle.
